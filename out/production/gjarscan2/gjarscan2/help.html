            <td>        <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <p>This application has visual user interface for modified Jarscan command line application (Java).</p>
                <p>This is used to search a class(es) or package(s) (or file) from inside of jar (or possible .zip) files
                    below a given directory and its subdirectory. The application will list all classes and jar files after search value, which are founded below given directories.</p>
                <h3>Usage</h3>
                <p>Press 'New Jarscan'-button at first, if needed. Then fill both textfields, select the combobox or another options
                    before to press a execute button. Results of an execution are showing in the list.</p>

                <p>
                    Instead of a directory value for a search, a value can also be an environment variable (like: %JAVA_HOME%).
                    When you are writing a class name with package name, you can use the / character in the place of . package separator.
                </p>

                <p>After a successfully search, select a 'Library Path:' jar row inside of the result list and then dual click it with the mouse. That will copy jar file path
                    into system clipboard. Then it is easy paste that value into your settings.</p>
                <p>You can also select a row wich is starting: 'Class:' and dual click that row to copy into the clipboard.</p>

                <h4>Search inside of result list rows</h4>
                <p>Fill Search inside result textfield with some text and press 'Search inside result'-button.
                    If founded, all matched list rows are showing with violet color. When pressed 'Next' or 'Previous' buttons
                some of those violet rows is showing with black backgrouond color and with white text. If you continue
                    to press those two buttons the black row is changing its place in list rows.</p>
