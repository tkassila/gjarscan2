            <td>        <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <p>This application has visual user interface for modified Jarscan command line application (Java).</p>
                <p>This is used to search a class(es) or package(s) (or file) from inside of jar (or possible .zip) files
                    below a given directory and its subdirectory. The application will list all classes and jar files after search value, which are founded below given directories.</p>
                <h3>Usage</h3>
                <p>Press 'New Jarscan'-button at first, if needed. Then fill both textfields, select the combobox or another options
                    before to press a execute button. Results of an execution are showing in the list.</p>

                <p>
                    Instead of a directory value for a search, a value can also be an environment variable (like: %JAVA_HOME% OR $JAVA_HOME).
                    When you are writing a class name with package name, you can use the / character in the place of . package separator.
                </p>

                <p>After a successfully search, select a 'Library Path:' jar row inside of the result list and then double click it with the mouse.
                    That will copy jar file path into the system clipboard. Then it is easy paste that value into your settings.</p>
                <p>You can also select a row wich is starting: 'Class:' and double click that row to copy into the clipboard.</p>

                <h4>Search inside of result list rows</h4>
                <p>Fill Search inside result text field with some text and press 'Search inside result'-button.
                    If founded, all matched list rows are showing with violet color. When pressed 'Next' or 'Previous' buttons
                some of those violet rows is showing with black background color and with white text. If you continue
                    to press those two buttons the black row is changing its place in list rows.</p>

                <h4>Founded jar file rows and mouse</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Double click in "Class:" -row to get a class name into the clipboard.</li>
                    <li>Double click in "Library Path:" -row to get a library path into the clipboard.</li>
                    <li>Double click in "Library Path:" -row to get a library path converted into maven dependency
                        xml block, if you have selected 'into maven' checkbox before clicking a row.</li>
                    <li>Double click in "Library Path:" -row to get a library path converted into gradle dependency
                        implementation, if you have selected 'into gradle' checkbox before clicking a row.</li>
                    <li>Right wheel click in "Library Path:" -row to get a jar module name and description into a popup dialog.
                        <b>This is the case, when you have jdk/jre 9 or later!</b></li>
                </ul>

                <h4>4K resolution screen and linux</h4>
                <p>Use export GDK_SCALE=2 or like value in star .sh scripts, if your java(jx) application has too small fonts etc.
                Seems that correspond jvm options: -Dsun.java2d.uiScale=2.5 does not  work?!!</p>
